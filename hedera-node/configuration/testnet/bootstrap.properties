# This file needs to exist even though there aren't any properties in it.
# Downstream processes depend on its existence.
# This is an exact replica of file 121 on testnet and must match application.properties exactly.
# It will be used by mono-service for all the property overrides.
# This file will be deprecated when we deprecate using the mono-service config and fully move to hedera-config.
