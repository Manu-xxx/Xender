# EVM Transaction Response Codes in Hedera

When executing an EVM transaction to a smart contract using `contractCall` in Hedera and it fails, a response code is present in the transaction receipt to indicate the top-level status.

The default status for a failing `contractCall` is CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTED, which is included in the receipt. Child transactions might have more specific errors.
In certain cases, the top-level status may differ from CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTED. The errors listed below are those special cases that can occur during the execution of a transaction and will be propagated as the top-level status.

The handling of those cases currently happens [here](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/774ed309600e4b4acd9e1ca72fcd87d354c8b9ff/hedera-node/hedera-smart-contract-service-impl/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/contract/impl/hevm/HederaEvmTransactionResult.java#L141-L169), in the `HederaEvmTransactionResult` in the `finalStatus()` method.


## Possible Propagated Response Codes

Note: The description for the statuses is copied from [protobuf repo](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs/blob/main/services/response_code.proto)

- **INVALID_SOLIDITY_ADDRESS**
    -  The system is not able to find the userâ€™s Solidity address.

- **INVALID_ALIAS_KEY**
    -  An alias used in a CryptoTransfer transaction is not the serialization of a primitive Key message. This means a Key with a single Ed25519 or ECDSA(secp256k1) public key and no unknown protobuf fields.

- **INVALID_SIGNATURE**
    -  The transaction signature is not valid.

- **MAX_ENTITIES_IN_PRICE_REGIME_HAVE_BEEN_CREATED**
    -  The maximum number of entities allowed in the current price regime have been created.

- **INSUFFICIENT_GAS**
    -  Not enough gas was supplied to execute the transaction.

- **LOCAL_CALL_MODIFICATION_EXCEPTION**
    -  Local execution (query) is requested for a function which changes state.

- **MAX_CHILD_RECORDS_EXCEEDED**
    -  A contract transaction tried to use more than the allowed number of child records, either through system contract records or internal contract creations.

- **INVALID_CONTRACT_ID**
    -  The contract ID is invalid or does not exist.

- **INVALID_FEE_SUBMITTED**
    -  The fee submitted is invalid.

- **MAX_CONTRACT_STORAGE_EXCEEDED**
    -  Contract permanent storage exceeded the currently allowable limit.

- **MAX_STORAGE_IN_PRICE_REGIME_HAS_BEEN_USED**
    -  All contract storage allocated to the current price regime has been consumed.

- **INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE**
    -  The fee provided in the transaction is insufficient for this type of transaction.

- **INSUFFICIENT_PAYER_BALANCE**
    -  The transaction payer could not afford a custom fee.

- **CONTRACT_EXECUTION_EXCEPTION**
    -  This code is used for any contract execution-related error not handled by specific error codes listed above.
    - *Example:* An error in Besu due to differences in supported Solidity versions. For instance, if Besu supports up to 0.8.23 and the contract is compiled with a version higher than 0.8.23 containing opcode changes, this error would be thrown.

- **CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTED**
    -  The default error for contract execution being reverted. Which also happens when REVERT OPCODE is executed in the contract.
