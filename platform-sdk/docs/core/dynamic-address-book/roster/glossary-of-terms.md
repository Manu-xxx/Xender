## Consensus Terminology

### Latest Consensus Round

The most recent round to have reached consensus.  (equal to the pending consensus round - 1)

### Pending Consensus Round

The round that the consensus algorithm is currently attempting to reach consensus on. (equal to the latest 
consensus round + 1)

### Rounds Non-Ancient

A setting. The number of rounds that have reached consensus that are not ancient.  Currently set to 26 in all 
environments. 

### Ancient

An event is ancient if its `birthRound` is less than or equal to the`latest consensus round` - `rounds non-ancient`.

### Minimum Round Non-Ancient

`minRoundNonAncient` is the minimum round that is considered non-ancient.  This is equal to the `pending consensus 
round` - `rounds non-ancient`.

### Non-Ancient Event Window

Specifies the window of events that are being considered in consensus.  The window specified the following:
* `latestConsensusRound` - the latest round that has reached consensus.
* `minRoundNonAncient` - the minimum round that is considered non-ancient.
* `minGenNonAncient` - the minimum generation that is considered non-ancient.  (This is deprecated). 

## Roster Terminology

### Roster (a.k.a Consensus Roster)

The collection of nodes which create events and participate in consensus.  Prior to the dynamic address book effort, 
this was called the `AddressBook` in the platform's code.  The name was changed to `Roster` to disambiguate it from 
Hedera's concept of an address book.  Hedera's address book contains the consensus roster.  

### Effective Roster (for a round) 

The roster that was used to determine consensus for a particular round.  The `effective roster for round X` is the 
roster that was used to compute consensus for round X. 

The effective roster is used for more than just consensus:
* **Networking** - determine who to connect to and facilitate mutual TLS connection with that node. 
* **Event Creation** - determine which other nodes' events are available to use as parents of events.
* **Event Validation** - validate the signature using the signing key of the node that created the event.
* **State Validation** - validating the signatures on the state of a round using the signatures in the effective 
  roster for that round.

### Roster's Effective Round
The round that the roster will be used to calculate consensus for. This is the round number used to look up the 
appropriate roster to validate an event. The event contains this round number as the event's `birthRound` and is 
used to uniquely identify the roster that should be used to validate the event.

Not a field inside the roster. 

### Roster's Creation Round

The round of transactions that created this roster once they were applied to the state. 

### Roster Offset

A setting.  The number of rounds it takes for a roster to become effective after being created. This is likely to be 
a small integer value, e.g. 2. If this number is 2, then processing all the transactions in round 100 yields the 
effective roster for round 102.

## Event Terminology

### Event Fields

Events have four parts to them: 
1. Hashed Data
2. Signature
3. Consensus scratchpad
4. Generated by consensus

### Birth Round

`birthRound` - The pending consensus round as known by the event creator thread at the time the event was created. 

This field allows nodes to determine if the event is ancient or not. 

Uniquely defines the roster that should be used when validating this event.  An event with birth round X should be 
validated using the roster with an effective round of X. 

### Consensus Round

`consensusRound` - The round in which an event reaches consensus.  Previously known as `roundReceived`.

### Current Round

Used only in the consensus algorithm. Previously known as `roundCreated`. In the future, this data will 
not be exposed outside of consensus.
