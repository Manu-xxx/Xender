# Durably Persist Self-Events Before Gossip

---

## Summary

If a self-event is gossiped and the node is shutdown before the self-event is persisted to disk, then the node will
branch in the hashgraph on restart by building a new self-event on the same self-event parent it had previously used.
In other words, _a node must only tell the world of a self-event **after** it has recorded this information!_

This proposal ensures self-events are persisted to disk before they are gossiped. It simplifies the relationship
between the consensus engine and the PCES writer, removing the need for the PCES sequencer, the `RoundDurabilityBuffer`,
and the responsibility of the consensus engine to tell the PCES writer when to flush, while introducing negligible
additional latency.

## Purpose and Context

Nodes in the network create new "self-events" on a regular basis. These self-events carry transactions that were
submitted to the node, and advance the hashgraph. When a node creates a self-event, it must build upon the previous
self-event and some "other parent" event (see the hashgraph algorithm for more details). If a node builds two
self-events on the same self-event parent, then the hashgraph will branch. Branching in the hashgraph is considered an
attack on consensus. It can be detected deterministically and the offending node punished accordingly, protecting the
integrity of the hashgraph. Therefore, no honest node should ever branch.

Today even honest nodes can branch. This happens when a node gossips a self-event and is shutdown before the event has
been persisted to disk in the Pre-Consensus Event Stream (PCES). On restart, the PCES is replayed to populate the
system with missing events, and other events that occurred since the node went down are retrieved via gossip. But there
is a time between when the node starts up and sends a new self-event and when it receives its old self-event from other
nodes. During this time, the node will build a new self-event on the same parent as the previous self-event, causing a
branch.

This happens today on update boundaries when **every node** deterministically shutdown and then start back up.

### Requirements

1. There must not be any noticeable impact in time-to-consensus.
2. Self-events must be persisted before they are gossiped or handled by Hashgraph
3. Persistence must be durable even if the JVM crashes

### Design Decisions

The flushing mechanism used by the PCES writer supports batched flushing. Each flush operation is relatively expensive,
so an explicit "flush" wire was added from the hashgraph to the PCES writer to indicate when it should flush a round.
This flush operation has to complete before the associated round can be handled, so there is also a wire from the
PCES writer to the `RoundDurabilityBuffer` to prevent handling of a round until all events within the round have been
written to disk.

We propose to remove these extra complications (PCES Sequencer, `RoundDurabilityBuffer`, consensus control of flush,
"keystone" events). Instead, let the PCES writer use a memory mapped file. It should be fast enough, and maintain all
the persistence guarantees we require. This means we can send events directly from event intake into the PCES, and
directly from PCES into consensus and, for self-events, into the gossip engine.

This allows us to remove the flush call and the PCES Sequencer, while also closing the loophole causing branching.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Force the PCES to flush after the last self event is created when freezing

If the PCES is forced to flush after the last self event is created when freezing, then the PCES will be in a consistent
state when restarted. However, this does not solve the problem if a deterministic crash affects all nodes, and it does
not get us closer to the end-state of a simpler system.

## Changes

### Architecture and/or Components

At a high level, the architecture remains the same: events are created by the "Event Creator System", they are gossiped
by the "Gossip System", events are handled by the "Event Intake System", persisted by the
"Pre-Consensus Recording System", and come to consensus in the "Consensus System".

![consensusPlatformArch](consensusPlatformArch.png)

In this case, we are only interested in _self events_. These are created by the `Event Creator System` and passed to
the `Event Intake System`. Here, they are ordered and validated and sent to the `Preconsensus Recording System`. Here,
they will be immediately persisted using `MemoryMappedFile` and then sent to the `Consensus System` and to the
`Gossip System`.

### Impact on Wiring

#### PCES Writer

PCES Writer will be changed to use `MemoryMappedFile`. The `flush` API will be removed (or, at least, no longer used
by the consensus engine. It may be required for clean shutdown, which will be handled by another issue).

#### Asynchronous writing changes

Currently, PCES writing happens asynchronously. That is, an event is inserted into the PCES writer, and while
the event is in the process of being written, other parts of the system utilize it. When it comes time to handle
transactions in a round, we pause if the keystone event for that round has not yet been made durable on disk.

After this change is made, no part of the system after event intake will utilize an event until it has been made
durable by the PcesWriter, except for Gossip. Gossip will only have to wait for self-events to be persisted. 

#### PcesSequencer removal

The `PcesSequencer` will no longer be necessary and can be removed. There will also be no need for keystone events
within rounds.

#### RoundDurabilityBuffer removal

The `RoundDurabilityBuffer` will no longer be necessary and can be removed.

#### Diagram Changes

In this image, several existing components are crossed out. This represents a component being removed. The data will
still flow along the same pathways, but with no component on that wire.

### Core Behaviors

[JEP 352](https://openjdk.org/jeps/352) enhanced the support for `MemoryMappedFile` to support the semantics we need
for non-volatile memory:

> This JEP proposes to upgrade MappedByteBuffer to support access to non-volatile memory (NVM). The only API change
> required is a new enumeration employed by FileChannel clients to request mapping of a file located on an NVM-backed
> file system rather than a conventional, file storage system. Recent changes to the MappedByteBuffer API mean that it
> supports all the behaviours needed to allow direct memory updates and provide the durability guarantees needed for
> higher level, Java client libraries to implement persistent data types (e.g. block file systems, journaled logs,
> persistent objects, etc.). The implementations of FileChannel and MappedByteBuffer need revising to be aware of this
> new backing type for the mapped file.

However, it also limits support for these more rigorous semantics to Linux:

> The target OS/CPU platform combinations for this JEP are Linux/x64 and Linux/AArch64. This restriction is imposed for
> two reasons. This feature will only work on OSes that support the mmap system call MAP_SYNC flag, which allows
> synchronous mapping of non-volatile memory. That is true of recent Linux releases. It will also only work on CPUs that
> support cache line writeback under user space control. x64 and AArch64 both provide instructions meeting this
> requirement.

Only Linux is used today in production deployments. Should MacOS or Windows be used in the future, we may need to look
into equivalent solutions for those platforms, or use something other than memory mapped files on those platforms, with
a corresponding impact on time to finality for those hosts.

The [Man Page for mmap(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html) on Linux describes the MAP_SYNC flag:

> MAP_SYNC (since Linux 4.15)
>    This flag is available only with the MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE
>    mapping type; mappings of type MAP_SHARED will silently
>    ignore this flag.  This flag is supported only for files
>    supporting DAX (direct mapping of persistent memory).  For
>    other files, creating a mapping with this flag results in
>    an EOPNOTSUPP error.
>
>    Shared file mappings with this flag provide the guarantee
>    that while some memory is mapped writable in the address
>    space of the process, it will be visible in the same file
>    at the same offset even after the system crashes or is
>    rebooted.  In conjunction with the use of appropriate CPU
>    instructions, this provides users of such mappings with a
>    more efficient way of making data modifications
>    persistent.

### Performance

It may be that a little more latency will exist now that self events must be persisted before they are gossiped. There
is also some theoretical new latency for each event because it is written to disk before being sent to consensus. In
both cases it is expected to be negligible. If the additional latency for self-events is significant, it can present
marked impacts on stability of the system during gossip.

## Test Plan

### Integration Tests

- Verify that self-events are persisted before they are gossiped
- Verify that the system can handle a deterministic crash of all nodes without branching
- Verify that the system can handle a hard crash of a single node without creating a branch

### Performance Tests

- Verify that the additional latency is negligible
- Verify that the system remains stable under load testing
